Hi Git, hi GitHub and hi person who's reading this.

This is my first repository and my first try with Git and GitHub.
In this repository I will commit all my exercises in coding with various languages I am studying.
Most of them are little projects, with few lines and that accomplish simple tasks. Nevertheless these represents the product of hours of commitment and many try-and-fail routines before achieving the wanted result so, even if immature, I feel no shame on these projects and hope that nobody will.
More, I am not a native english speaker (I'm italian) so I apologize if some weird stuff get occasionally out of my mouth!
