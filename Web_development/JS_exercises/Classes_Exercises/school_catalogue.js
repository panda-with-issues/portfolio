/*
* This project is provided by codecademy.com
* Letâ€™s put your knowledge of classes to the test by creating a digital school catalog for the New York City Department of Education. The Department of Education wants the catalog to hold quick reference material for each school in the city.
* We need to create classes for primary, middle, and high schools. Because these classes share properties and methods, each will inherit from a parent School class. Our parent and three child classes have the following properties, getters, setters, and methods:
*
* School
*
*   Properties: name (string), level (one of three strings: 'primary', 'middle', or 'high'), and numberOfStudents (number)
*   Getters: all properties have getters
*   Setters: the numberOfStudents property has a setter
*   Methods: .quickFacts() and .pickSubstituteTeacher() (this is a static method)
*
* Primary
*
*   Includes everything in the School class, plus one additional property
*   Properties: pickupPolicy (string)
*
* Middle
*
*   Does not include any additional properties or methods
*
* High
*
*   Includes everything in the School class, plus one additional property
*   Properties: sportsTeams (array of strings)
